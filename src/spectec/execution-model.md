# Execution Model

When you run `nano-p4spectec`, two separate artifacts are at play: a
**specification** (your `.watsup` files) and a **program** (a `.p4` source
file).

## Overview

```
.watsup files                    .p4 file
     │                              │
     ▼                              ▼
┌─────────┐                    ┌─────────┐
│  elab   │                    │  parse  │
└────┬────┘                    └────┬────┘
     │                              │
     ▼                              ▼
 spec (IL)                   program (IL value)
     │                              │
     └───────────────┬──────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ interpreter │
              └──────┬──────┘
                     │
                     ▼
               relation result
            (pass / fail / packets)
```

There are two independent compilation steps, and the interpreter joins their
outputs.

## Step 1: Elaborate the spec

The `.watsup` files are parsed and _elaborated_ into _IL_ (Internal Language), a
type-checked and desugared representation of the spec that the interpreter
executes directly.

_Elaboration_ checks that the spec itself is well-formed: syntax definitions are
consistent, rule conclusions match their relation signatures, function clauses
are well-typed, and so on.

You can run this step in isolation with:

```shell
$ ./nano-p4spectec elab nano-p4/spec/*.watsup
```

## Step 2: Parse the program

The `.p4` source file is parsed by the Nano-P4 parser into a **P4-SpecTec IL
value**. It is a tree of constructor tags and nested values that directly
mirrors the `syntax` definitions in the spec. Because it is a value in the same
language that the spec is written in, the interpreter can pass it directly to
spec relations.

You can inspect this value with:

```shell
$ ./nano-p4spectec parse -p <file> -i nano-p4/include
```

The `-t` flag prints it as an indented tree, which is easier to read:

```shell
$ ./nano-p4spectec parse -t -p <file> -i nano-p4/include
```

```
$ cat action.p4

    bit<8> x = 8w42;
}

$ ./nano-p4spectec parse \
    -i nano-p4/include \
    -p action.p4 \
    -t

                ├── baseType BIT <%>
                │   └── +8
                ├── identifier `ID %
                │   └── "x"
                └── initializer = %
                    └── integerLiteral % W %
                        ├── 8
                        └── +42
```

</details>

## Step 3: Interpret

The interpreter takes the elaborated spec and the program value and executes a
relation against the program. The relation is specified with `-rel`:

```shell
$ ./nano-p4spectec run nano-p4/spec/*.watsup \
    -i nano-p4/include \
    -rel Program_ok \
    -p <file>
```

For example, this command takes a `.p4` program, converts it to an IL value, and
passes it to the `Program_ok` relation. The `Program_ok` relation type-checks an
entire program. Therefore, we are executing the typechecker against a program.

## What this means in practice

- A **spec error** (syntax, type, or rule error in `.watsup`) surfaces during
  elaboration, before the program is touched.
- A **parse error** means the `.p4` file is not valid Nano-P4 syntax.
- A **runtime error** means the interpreter got stuck executing the spec against
  the program. This is typically due to a rule that has no matching case for the
  given input.
- A **test failure** from `sim` means the spec's dynamic semantics produced
  different output packets than the STF file expected.
